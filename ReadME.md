Steps Completed :- 

I have created a simple index.html file . 

I have created the docker file and nginx.conf file to deploy as well . Its running on Local

I have created the public ECR also but deploying to the ECR requires AWS CLI ACCESS ID which I don't have hence not able to push that into ECR .. I had raised a ticket as well but they closed the ticket saying faculty indicated AWS Access ID provided where it has actually not been . Kindly consider .
